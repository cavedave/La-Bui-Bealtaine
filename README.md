# Why 

We want people to learn Irish so we should provide them with easy access to materials to do so. Lá Buí Bealtaine by Máiréad Ní Ghrada, and An Casán by Séamus de Bhilmot are on the Junior cert syllabus and should have Irish Text, Irish Audio and English text available. This will allow the common [Listening Reading](https://www.jonkenpo.net/method-listening-reading/) [learning](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=6366) method to be used.

The texts are about 20 minutes long. So if people can read the english. Knowing the outline, carefully read the irish while listening to the audio. Go back and look up any difficult passages. Then listen to the audio again while commuting etc. That will allow them to learn a lot from this one text fairly easily. 

# Todo

If you can help with any of these please contact me.

- Proof the Irish Text to remove errors
- Make a good Audio Recording of the Irish text. This can be put up on Soundcloud, youtube etc. The easier it is to find the better.
- Fix the English translation. At the moment it is machine translated and that is not at all good.
- Go back and add itlics to stage directions etc.
